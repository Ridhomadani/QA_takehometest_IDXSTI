Sony is so confident that the VAIO S is a superior 
ultraportable laptop that the company proudly compares the notebook to 
Apple&quot; , &quot;'&quot; , &quot;s 13-inch MacBook Pro. And in a lot of ways this notebook is 
better, thanks to a lighter weight, higher-resolution display, more 
storage space, and a Blu-ray drive.
